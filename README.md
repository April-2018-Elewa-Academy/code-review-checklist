# code-review-checklist

## Why do we code review? 
* To memorize everything that we all learned 
* A consistent code style for our projects
* To know each other work
* To make better software
* To stay humble
* To know how to play in team
* To practice talking about the code
* To practice reading code bases

## teamwork
* shared knowledge means better estimates
* people learning form eachother
* teamwork helps better reach the goal because of shared knowledge and input
* agile teams
* no one is irrelevant to a decision
* everyone can contribute

## good practices
* good practices are good for you and your team  
* 2 reviews before merge to master
* integrates into existing processes
* practice lightweight
* focus on the algorithms
* automate trivial checks
* decentralized
* know standards
* use tools to make your live easier  
* use the app/ the perspective of the user to review (detect problems)
* set up a timeframe (do them immediately)

## human side in team
* reach concensus with the person you're speaking with
* ask the author, don't tell
* don't take it personally - your code sucks, not you
* mistakes are natural, someone is always better at something
* be kind to the coder, not the code
* respect juniorer developers
* every team or person is different (general take away)
* always aprove unless you can prove / trust team mates - believe they know what they are doing (general take away)
