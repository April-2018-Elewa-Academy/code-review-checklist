### after request - developer
* Read your code reviewer's explanation of your code.  Get back to them:  
  * Were they right about what you intended?
  * Did you learn something from their interpretation?
  * Did they mis-understand something key?
* Trust your reviewer. Implement their suggestions unless they're flat-out wrong:
  * This will help to promote a more stylistically consistent code base.
