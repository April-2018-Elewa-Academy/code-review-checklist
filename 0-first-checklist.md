## Reviewer

### Why reviewing code?

 - Are there any obvious logic errors in the code?
 - Looking at the requirements, are all cases fully implemented?
 - Are the new automated tests sufficient for the new code? Do existing automated tests need to be rewritten to account for changes in the code?
 - Does the new code conform to existing style guidelines?

### Reviewing process

  - Prioritize goals for code review (e.g. catch bug? understand the way each other think?... think about what is the goal of one     particular review) (concrete take away)  
  - Use the app/ the perspective of the user to review (detect problems)  
  - Set up a timeframe (do them immediately)  
  - Copy to another repository / work in isolation (read code in a realistic environment)  
  - Imagine your own solution before reviewing  
  - Quiz yourself on their code to make sure you understand it
  - Write an explanation of how you think their code works and why
  - Limit yourself to an hour at a time
  - Make visual representations/diagrams (figure out/understand) what their code is doing (concrete take away)
