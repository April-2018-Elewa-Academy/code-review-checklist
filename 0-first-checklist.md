# Code Review Checklist


## Evan's contribution

### before request - developer
* Provide a clear and focused list of concerns & features to be reviewed
* Annotate your code when necessary
* Create a separate branch with (as much as possible) only the code to be reviewed
* Provide a this template in your project with your "before" section completed

### during request - reviewer
* Critique the code, not the coder
* Comment on behavior, not implementation
* Be prompt.  If you can't do this review, help them find someone who can
* Isolate their code in a new repository for simpilcity and focus
* Investigate the code in your own development environment
* Run the code. It will be easier to get it by itneraction than by code reading
* Diagram the code's behavior
* Quiz yourself on their code to make sure you understand it
* Write an explanation of how you think their code works and why
* Limit yourself to an hour at a time
* Provide positive, constructive, feedback
* Trust your developer, when in doubt approve their code

### after request - developer
* Read your code reviewer's explanation of your code.  Get back to them:  
  * Were they right about what you intended?
  * Did you learn something from their interpretation?
  * Did they mis-understand something key?
* Trust your reviewer. Implement their suggestions unless they're flat-out wrong:
  * This will help to promote a more stylistically consistent code base
